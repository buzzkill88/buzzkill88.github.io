    <h3>/* Version 2.0 6/2012 MDG
<h3>*/
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>// We'll use analog input 0 to measure the temperature sensor's
<h3>// signal pin.
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>const int temperaturePin = 0;
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>void setup()
<h3>{
 <h3> // In this sketch, we'll use the Arduino's serial port
 <h3> // to send text back to the main computer. For both sides to
 <h3> // communicate properly, they need to be set to the same speed.
 <h3> // We use the Serial.begin() function to initialize the port
 <h3> // and set the communications speed.
  <h3>
 <h3> // The speed is measured in bits per second, also known as
  <h3>// "baud rate". 9600 is a very commonly used baud rate,
 <h3> // and will transfer about 10 characters per second.
 <h3> 
 <h3> Serial.begin(9600);
<h3>}
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>void loop()
<h3>{
 <h3> // Up to now we've only used integer ("int") values in our
 <h3> // sketches. Integers are always whole numbers (0, 1, 23, etc.).
 <h3> // In this sketch, we'll use floating-point values ("float").
 <h3> // Floats can be fractional numbers such as 1.42, 2523.43121, etc.
<h3>
<h3>
 <h3> // We'll declare three floating-point variables
 <h3> // (We can declare multiple variables of the same type on one line:)
<h3>
<h3>
 <h3> float voltage, degreesC, degreesF;
<h3>
<h3>
 <h3> // First we'll measure the voltage at the analog pin. Normally
 <h3> // we'd use analogRead(), which returns a number from 0 to 1023.
 <h3> // Here we've written a function (further down) called
 <h3> // getVoltage() that returns the true voltage (0 to 5 Volts)
 <h3> // present on an analog input pin.
<h3>
<h3>
 <h3> voltage = getVoltage(temperaturePin);
  <h3>
 <h3> // Now we'll convert the voltage to degrees Celsius.
  <h3>// This formula comes from the temperature sensor datasheet:
<h3>
<h3>
 <h3> degreesC = (voltage - 0.5) * 100.0;
  <h3>
 <h3> // While we're at it, let's convert degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.
 <h3> // This is the classic C to F conversion formula:
  <h3>
 <h3> degreesF = degreesC * (9.0/5.0) + 32.0;
  <h3>
  <h3>// Now we'll use the serial port to print these values
  <h3>// to the serial monitor!
  <h3>
  <h3>// To open the serial monitor window, upload your code,
  <h3>// then click the "magnifying glass" button at the right edge
  <h3>// of the Arduino IDE toolbar. The serial monitor window
 <h3> // will open.
<h3>
<h3>
  <h3>// (NOTE: remember we said that the communication speed
 <h3> // must be the same on both sides. Ensure that the baud rate
 <h3> // control at the bottom of the window is set to 9600. If it
  <h3>// isn't, change it to 9600.)
  <h3>
  <h3>// Also note that every time you upload a new sketch to the
  <h3>// Arduino, the serial monitor window will close. It does this
  <h3>// because the serial port is also used to upload code!
  <h3>// When the upload is complete, you can re-open the serial
  <h3>// monitor window.
  <h3>
  <h3>// To send data from the Arduino to the serial monitor window,
  <h3>// we use the Serial.print() function. You can print variables
  <h3>// or text (within quotes).
<h3>
<h3>
  <h3>Serial.print("voltage: ");
 <h3> Serial.print(voltage);
  <h3>Serial.print("  deg C: ");
  <h3>Serial.print(degreesC);
  <h3>Serial.print("  deg F: ");
  <h3>Serial.println(degreesF);
<h3>
<h3>
  <h3>// These statements will print lines of data like this:
  <h3>// "voltage: 0.73 deg C: 22.75 deg F: 72.96"
<h3>
<h3>
 <h3> // Note that all of the above statements are "print", except
 <h3> // for the last one, which is "println". "Print" will output
 <h3> // text to the SAME LINE, similar to building a sentence
 <h3> // out of words. "Println" will insert a "carriage return"
 <h3> // character at the end of whatever it prints, moving down
 <h3> // to the NEXT line.
   <h3>
  <h3>delay(1000); // repeat once per second (change as you wish!)
<h3>}
<h3><h3>
<h3><h3>
<h3><h3>
<h3><h3>
<h3>float getVoltage(int pin)</h3>
<h3>{
 <h3> // This function has one input parameter, the analog pin number
  <h3>// to read. You might notice that this function does not have
 <h3> // "void" in front of it; this is because it returns a floating-
 <h3> // point value, which is the true voltage on that pin (0 to 5V).
  
 <h3> // You can write your own functions that take in parameters
 <h3> // and return values. Here's how:
  <h3>
   <h3> // To take in parameters, put their type and name in the
   <h3> // parenthesis after the function name (see above). You can
   <h3> // have multiple parameters, separated with commas.
    <h3>
   <h3> // To return a value, put the type BEFORE the function name
   <h3> // (see "float", above), and use a return() statement in your code
   <h3> // to actually return the value (see below).
  <h3>
  <h3>  // If you don't need to get any parameters, you can just put
  <h3>  // "()" after the function name.
  <h3>
   <h3> // If you don't need to return a value, just write "void" before
   <h3> // the function name.
<h3>
<h3>
 <h3> // Here's the return statement for this function. We're doing
 <h3> // all the math we need to do within this statement:
  <h3>
 <h3> return (analogRead(pin) * 0.004882814);
  
  <h3>// This equation converts the 0 to 1023 value that analogRead()
 <h3> // returns, into a 0.0 to 5.0 value that is the true voltage
  <h3>// being read at that pin.
<h3>}
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>// Other things to try with this code:
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>//   Turn on an LED if the temperature is above or below a value.
<h3>
<h3>
<h3>//   Read that threshold value from a potentiometer - now you've
<h3>//   created a thermostat!
